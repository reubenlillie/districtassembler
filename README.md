# DistrictAssembler

Let's optimize district operations in the Church of the Nazarene.

## Synopsis

Let's create a scalable [WordPress plugin][WP Plugin Page] to make district operations *less about paper* and *more about people*.

1. Turn the District Journal into an online database and social network built on top of [BuddyPress][BuddyPress Codex]

  *what was a shelved directory can be more directly related to the people involved*

1. Make District Assembly completely paperless: 

  *a strealined environment with dynamic and responsive agendas, reports, ballots, and other important documents*

1. Transform events calendars into specialized invitations

  *offering electronic calendar formats for year-round invitations, RSVPs, and reminders*

1. Exchange occasional meetings for continously collaborative groups

  *imagine technology that actually makes meetings more productive*

**Compliant with the [*Manual of the Church of the Nazarene*][Manual] and the [*WordPress Plugin Handbook*][WP Plugin Handbook]**

## Motivation

The [*Manual of the Church of the Nazarene*][Manual 200] calls a district:

> an entity made up of interdependent local churches organized to facilitate the mission of each local church through mutual support, the sharing of resources, and collaboration ([200][Manual 200]).

The problem is:

* facilitating the mission is often threatened by the need to maintain facilities,
* mutual support is often at risk of becoming a series of self-inflicted, one-way, top-down "relationships",
* and the impulse to share resources is routinely hindered by a lack of shared responsibility, all because . . .

. . . people make collaboration difficult. 

Let's collaborate.

Let's harnass the web to make a district's administrative tasks come alive through the people who run it.

Let's make social media and content management into a service of the church.

## Installation

An initial version of the source code files will be uploaded soon.

### i18n (i.e., internationalization) Tools

DistrictAssembler creates a variable for the textdomain used when internationalizing strings throughout the source code. 

To take advantage of this method, these tools are recommended for providing correct, translatable files:

* [Poedit](http://www.poedit.net/)
* [makepot](http://i18n.svn.wordpress.org/tools/trunk/)
* [i18n](https://github.com/grappler/i18n)

*Please, help translate*
