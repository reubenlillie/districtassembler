# DistrictAssembler

Let's optimize district operations in the Church of the Nazarene.

## Synopsis

Let's create a scalable [WordPress plugin](http://codex.wordpress.org/Writing_a_Plugin) to make district operations *less about paper* and *more about people*.

1. Turn the District Journal into an online database and social network built on top of [BuddyPress](https://codex.buddypress.org/plugindev/)

1. Make District Assembly completely paperless: *a strealined environment with dynamically formatted electronic agendas, reports, ballots, and other important documents*

1. Transform events calendars into specialized invitations

1. Exchange occasional meetings for continously collaborative groups

Compliant with the [*Manual of the Church of the Nazarene*](nazarene.org/files/docs/Manual2013-17.pdf) and the [*WordPress Plugin Handbook*](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/the-basics/header-requirements/).

## Motivation

The [*Manual of the Church of the Nazarene*](nazarene.org/files/docs/Manual2013-17.pdf#page=108) calls a district:

> an entity made up of interdependent local churches organized to facilitate the mission of each local church through mutual support, the sharing of resources, and collaboration ([200](nazarene.org/files/docs/Manual2013-17.pdf#page=108)).

The problem is:

* facilitating the mission is often threatened by the need to maintain facilities,
* mutual support is often at risk of becoming a series of self-inflicted, one-way, top-down "relationships",
* and the impulse to share resources is routinely hindered by a lack or shared responsibility, all because . . .

. . . people make collaboration difficult. 

Let's collaborate.

Let's harnass the web to make a district's administrative tasks come alive through the people who run it.

Let's make social media and content management into a service of the church.

## Installation

An initial version of the source code files will be uploaded soon.

### i18n (i.e., internationalization) Tools

*Please, help translate*

DistrictAssembler uses a variable to store the text domain used when internationalizing strings throughout the source code. 

To take advantage of this method, there are tools that are recommended for providing correct, translatable files:

* [Poedit](http://www.poedit.net/)
* [makepot](http://i18n.svn.wordpress.org/tools/trunk/)
* [i18n](https://github.com/grappler/i18n)

Any of these tools should provide you with the proper tooling to internationalize the plugin.
